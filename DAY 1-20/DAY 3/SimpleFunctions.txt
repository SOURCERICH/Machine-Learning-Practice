1. Reading and Loading Data

pd.read_csv(): Reads data from a CSV file and creates a DataFrame.
pd.read_excel(): Reads data from an Excel file and creates a DataFrame.
np.loadtxt(): Loads data from a text file into a NumPy array.

2. Understanding the Data

df.head(): Displays the first few rows of a DataFrame.
df.shape: Returns the dimensions of the DataFrame (rows, columns).
df.info(): Provides information about the DataFrame, such as data types and missing values.
df.describe(): Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns.

3. Cleaning and Preprocessing Data

df.isnull(): Checks for missing values in the DataFrame.
df.dropna(): Drops rows or columns with missing values.
df.duplicated(): Checks for duplicate rows.
df.drop_duplicates(): Drops duplicate rows.
df.fillna(): Fills missing values with specified values.

4. Data Visualization

plt.plot(): Creates line plots.
plt.scatter(): Creates scatter plots.
sns.histplot(): Creates histograms.
sns.boxplot(): Creates box plots.
sns.heatmap(): Creates heatmaps.

5. Statistical Analysis

np.mean(): Calculates the mean of an array or DataFrame.
np.median(): Calculates the median of an array or DataFrame.
np.std(): Calculates the standard deviation of an array or DataFrame.
scipy.stats.ttest_ind(): Performs a t-test for two independent samples.

6. Data Aggregation and Grouping

Functions such as groupby(), agg(), and pivot_table() are commonly used for data aggregation and grouping.

7. Feature Engineering
Functions such as df.apply(), df.map(), and df.transform() are commonly used for feature engineering.

8. Handling Outliers
Outliers can significantly impact analysis and modeling. 
Functions such as np.percentile() and scipy.stats.zscore() can be used to detect and handle outliers.

9. Handling Dates and Time
If the dataset includes date and time information, Python provides functions for handling and manipulating dates and time. 
Functions such as pd.to_datetime(), dt.year, dt.month, and dt.day are useful for working with dates and time.
